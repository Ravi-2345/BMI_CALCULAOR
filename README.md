# BMI_CALCULAOR
In this repo, I've created my first local server using express framework of Node and have done the get and post requests on the server side rather doing it on the client side. This web page will allow us to get the additon of two numbers and BMI as a post requests from the server.
To run the code, download the node modules (using npm) which is shown under dependencies in package.json file.
